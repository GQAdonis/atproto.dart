/// ## Overview
///
/// The object representing `knownValues` defined in Lexicon as an Enum.
///
/// Although the `knownValues` defined in Lexicon are not technically Enums,
/// it is very useful to be able to treat these fields as type safe Enums.
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// ### Get JSON compatible value
///
/// ```dart
/// // JSON compatible value.
/// final value = KnownSubjectReviewState.something.value;
/// ```
///
/// ### Convert to [USubjectReviewState]
///
/// ```dart
/// final union = KnownSubjectReviewState.something.toUnion();
/// ```
enum KnownSubjectReviewState {
  /// Moderator review status of a subject: Open. Indicates that the
  /// subject needs to be reviewed by a moderator
  @JsonValue('#reviewOpen')
  reviewOpen('#reviewOpen'),

  /// Moderator review status of a subject: Escalated. Indicates that
  /// the subject was escalated for review by a moderator
  @JsonValue('#reviewEscalated')
  reviewEscalated('#reviewEscalated'),

  /// Moderator review status of a subject: Closed. Indicates that the
  /// subject was already reviewed and resolved by a moderator
  @JsonValue('#reviewClosed')
  reviewClosed('#reviewClosed'),

  /// Moderator review status of a subject: Unnecessary. Indicates that
  /// the subject does not need a review at the moment but there is
  /// probably some moderation related metadata available for it
  @JsonValue('#reviewNone')
  reviewNone('#reviewNone'),
  ;

  /// JSON value based on lexicon.
  final String value;

        return $value;
      }
    }

    return null;
  }
}

  /// Returns this value as [USubjectReviewState].

  bool get isReviewEscalated => this == KnownSubjectReviewState.reviewEscalated;

  /// Returns true if this value is not [reviewEscalated], otherwise false.
  bool get isNotReviewEscalated => !isReviewEscalated;

  /// Returns true if this value is [reviewClosed], otherwise false.
  bool get isReviewClosed => this == KnownSubjectReviewState.reviewClosed;

  /// Returns true if this value is not [reviewClosed], otherwise false.
  bool get isNotReviewClosed => !isReviewClosed;

  /// Returns true if this value is [reviewNone], otherwise false.

  bool get isNotReviewNone => !isReviewNone;
}

/// ## Overview
///
/// This is an union object to improve safety and convenience of objects
/// using Enum.
///
/// Enum provides a very powerful type for a specific group of data,
/// but at the same time it means a loss of flexibility: values not defined
/// in Enum are either completely ignored or an exception is thrown
/// if parsing fails. This union object exists to solve that problem.
///
/// This union object handles the `KnownValue`, a known enum value defined in Lexicon,
/// and the `UnknownValue`, an unknown string value not defined in Lexicon. In other words,
/// it can handle unknown values while enjoying the type safety of Enum.
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// ```dart
/// // use when syntax.
/// final value = object.when(
///   knownValue: (data) => data, // => KnownSubjectReviewState
///   unknownValue: (data) => data, // => String
/// );
///
/// // or simpler way.
/// if (object.isKnownValue) {
///   print(object.knownValue); // => KnownSubjectReviewState or null
/// } else if (object.isUnknownValue) {
///   print(object.unknownValue); // => String or null
/// }
/// ```
